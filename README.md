# semiunification

Semiunification is an undecidable problem. However, so-called "R-acyclic" semiunification problems can be solved. Here is my attempt.

The final goal of this is to write a relational type inferencer which should aid the program synthesis work of William E. Byrd, Greg Rosenblatt and others. This should be possible since certain type inference problems with let-polymorphism can be translated in a syntax-directed way into a (slight variant of an) R-ASUP instance.
